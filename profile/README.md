[Instill AI](https://www.instill.tech/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme) is on a mission to make AI highly accessible to everyone. We've been hard at work developing tools that simplify the process of unlocking value from unstructured data across all layers of the modern data stack. This means that organizations of all sizes can benefit from our endeavors. For a deeper dive into our vision, check out our blog post on [Why Instill AI exists](https://blog.instill.tech/why-instill-ai-exists/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme).

## What Are We Building?

We're dedicated to bringing AI into the modern data stack by solving unstructured data ETL. Our tools are built on an open and maintainable framework, designed to empower communities to benefit and actively engage.

### Instill Core: Open-source Unstructured Data Infrastructure Stack

Explore our open-source unstructured data infrastructure stack, comprising a collection of source-available projects designed to streamline every aspect of building versatile AI features with unstructured data. Dive into the potential in our [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs).

  <summary><b>üíß <a href="https://github.com/instill-ai/vdp" target="_blank">Instill VDP</a>: AI pipeline builder for unstructured data</b></summary><br>
  
  **Instill VDP**, or **VDP (Versatile Data Pipeline)**, represents a comprehensive unstructured data infrastructure. Its purpose is to simplify the journey of processing unstructured data from start to finish:

  - **Extract:** Gather unstructured data from diverse sources, including AI applications, cloud/on-prem storage, and IoT devices.
  - **Transform:** Utilize AI models to convert raw data into meaningful insights and actionable formats.
  - **Load:** Efficiently move processed data to warehouses, applications, or other destinations.

  Embracing VDP is straightforward, whether you opt for Instill Cloud deployment or self-hosting via Instill Core. Consult our comprehensive [documentation](https://www.instill.tech/docs/core/vdp/deployment/overview) to delve into VDP deployment.
