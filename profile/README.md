[Instill AI](https://www.instill.tech/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme) is on a mission to make AI highly accessible to everyone. We've been hard at work developing tools that simplify the process of unlocking value from unstructured data across all layers of the modern data stack. This means that organizations of all sizes can benefit from our endeavors. For a deeper dive into our vision, check out our blog post on [Why Instill AI exists](https://blog.instill.tech/why-instill-ai-exists/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme).

## What Are We Building?

We're dedicated to bringing AI into the modern data stack by solving unstructured data ETL. Our tools are built on an open and maintainable framework, designed to empower communities to benefit and actively engage.
