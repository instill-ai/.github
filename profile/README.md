Instill AI is on a mission to make Vision AI highly accessible to everyone. We build tools to streamline the process of distilling the value of unstructured visual data across all stakeholders in the modern data stack, to ultimately benefit all size organisations. Read our blog post [Why Instill AI exists](https://blog.instill.tech/why-instill-ai-exists/) on what is missing in the modern data stack and how we are going to fix it for more details.

## What are we building?

Our tools are built for the modern AI team to reduce team silo, decouple work dependency between different roles to increase work efficiency and the ability to be self-service. Developers with various backgrounds can benefit from our tools in different ways:

- **AI/ML Engineers**: automatic model optimization, simplified and managed model serving, and tools for production model monitoring
- **AI/ML Researchers**: easier access to visual data for production experimentation and benchmarking
- **Data Engineers**: low-code for integrating with various data sources and destinations, and easier visual data pipeline management
- **Data Scientists**: richer insights from unstructured visual data to uncover unknown patterns and produce better analysis

Most importantly, we aim to bring Vision AI into the modern data stack by standardising visual data preparation. Our tools are built within an open and maintainable framework, making it possible for communities to benefit and participate.

## Instill Cloud

Instill Cloud is currently in private alpha, working very closely with early users to build the most effective tool for visual data preparation. With Instill Cloud, you don't have to worry about managing infrastructure, scalability or latency. We provide

- ðŸ§° SDKs and CLI tools for developers to integrate with our existing data stack in minutes 
- âœ¨ console for non developers to start processing visual data without writing any code
- ðŸ˜Š premium support from Instill AI team
