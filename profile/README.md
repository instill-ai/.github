Instill AI is on a mission to make AI highly accessible to everyone. We build tools to streamline the process of distilling the value of unstructured data across all stakeholders in the modern data stack, to ultimately benefit all-size organisations. Read our blog post [Why Instill AI exists](https://blog.instill.tech/why-instill-ai-exists/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme) on what is missing in the modern data stack and how we are going to fix it for more details.

## What are we building?

Our tools are built for the modern AI team to reduce team silo, decouple work dependency between different roles to increase work efficiency and the ability to be self-service. Developers with various backgrounds can benefit from our tools in different ways:

- **AI/ML Engineers**: automatic model optimization, simplified and managed model serving, and tools for production model monitoring
- **AI/ML Researchers**: easier access to unstructured data for production experimentation and benchmarking
- **Data Engineers**: low-code for integrating with various data sources and destinations, and easier data pipeline management
- **Data Scientists**: richer insights from unstructured data to uncover unknown patterns and produce better analysis

Most importantly, we aim to bring AI into the modern data stack by standardising unstructured data ETL. Our tools are built within an open and maintainable framework, making it possible for communities to benefit and participate.

## Instill Cloud

Instill Cloud is currently in private alpha, working very closely with early users to build the most effective tool for unstructured data ETL. With Instill Cloud, you don't have to worry about managing infrastructure, scalability or latency. We provide

- ðŸ§° SDKs and CLI tools for developers to integrate with existing data stack in minutes 
- âœ¨ console for non developers to start processing unstructured data without writing any code
- ðŸ˜Š premium support from Instill AI team
