[Instill AI](https://www.instill-ai.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme) is on a mission to make AI highly accessible to everyone. We've been hard at work developing tools that simplify the process of unlocking value from unstructured data across all layers of the modern data stack. This means that organizations of all sizes can benefit from our efforts.

For a deeper dive into our vision, check out our blog post on [Why Instill AI Exists](https://www.instill-ai.com/blog/why-instill-ai-exists/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme).

## What Are We Building?

[**Instill Core CE (Community Edition)**](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core) is the open-source version of **Instill Core**, our modular AI platform.

**Instill Core CE** delivers out-of-the-box **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** capabilities for your applications. You can build AI-powered data pipelines, integrate retrieval systems, and deploy custom models in a flexible, developer-friendly environment. It’s ideal for teams exploring RAG workflows while maintaining full control over their infrastructure.

Our commercial offering, Instill Core, includes everything in CE—plus additional features like an integrated Instill Agent with a chat interface, and full support for managed deployments. Want Instill Core CE as a managed service? [Contact us](mailto:hello@instill-ai.com).
