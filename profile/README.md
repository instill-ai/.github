[Instill AI](https://www.instill-ai.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme) is on a mission to make AI highly accessible to everyone. We've been hard at work developing tools that simplify the process of unlocking value from unstructured data across all layers of the modern data stack. This means that organizations of all sizes can benefit from our endeavors. For a deeper dive into our vision, check out our blog post on [Why Instill AI exists](https://www.instill-ai.com/blog/why-instill-ai-exists/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=org_readme).

## What Are We Building?

[**Instill AI**](https://www.instill-ai.com) is a multi-agent framework, that allows all kinds of unstructured data to be processed and transformed into structured data to help knowledge exploration, discovery and analysis, based on the open-source project [**Instill Core**](https://github.com/instill-ai/instill-core), a full-stack AI platform for data, model and pipeline orchestration, designed to streamline every aspect of building versatile AI task agents.
